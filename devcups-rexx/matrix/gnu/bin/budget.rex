/*To return to the earlier example, one can easily ensure the proper order of operations by enclosing the
highest order operations in parentheses:
*/
say (400 * 300) - 2 /* displays: 10 */
/* To alter the order in which operations occur, just reposition the parentheses:*/
say 400 * (300 - 2) /* displays: 4 */

What This Book Covers
This book teaches standard Rexx, quickly and simply. It teaches you what you need to know to work
with Rexx on any platform. You’ll know a language that runs anywhere—from handheld devices such as
personal digital assistants, pocket PCs, Palm Pilots, and mobile and smart phones to desktop and laptop
PCs, with operating systems like Windows, Linux, and others, to midrange servers from all the major
vendors—right on up to the world’s largest mainframes. Rexx applies to almost any programming
problem.
Beyond the Rexx language proper, this book covers all the major interfaces into Web servers, databases,
GUIs, XML, and the like. It describes many of the free tools that are available to make scripting with
Rexx easier and more productive.
The book covers nine free Rexx interpreters. Eight of them meet the international standards for Rexx, yet
each adds its own special features and extensions. The book tells where to download each interpreter,
shows how to install it, and demonstrates how to make the most of its advantages and extensions.
All the Rexx interpreters, tools, and interfaces this book covers are free or open source. The one excep-
tion is IBM mainframe Rexx, which comes bundled with IBM’s operating systems.
In the end, this book covers not only Rexx scripting, but also the whole world of Rexx programming
across all environments and interfaces, and with all Rexx interpreters. It is truly a Rexx encyclopedia.
